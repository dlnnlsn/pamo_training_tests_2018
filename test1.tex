\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Geometry Exercise 1
We consider a square $ABCD$ and a point $E$ on the segment $CD$. The bisector of
$\angle EAB$ cuts the segment $BC$ in $F$. Prove that $BF + DE = AE$.

\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Combinatorics Exercise 2
On a $50 \times 50$ chessboard, we put, in the lower left corner, a die whose
faces are numbered from $1$ to $6$. By convention, the sum of digits on two
opposite side os the die equals $7$. Adama wants to move the die to the
diagonally opposite corner using the following rule: at each step, Adama can
roll the die only on to its right side, or to its top side. We suppose that
whenever the die lands on a square, the number on its bottom face is printed on
the square. By the end of these operations, Adama wants to find the sum of the
$99$ numbers appearing on the chessboard. What are the maximum and minimum
possible values of this sum?

\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Inequality Exercise 4
Find the maximum and minimum of the expression
\[
    \max(a_1, a_2) + \max(a_2, a_3), + \dots + \max(a_{n-1}, a_n) + \max(a_n, a_1),
\]
where $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$ runs over the set of permutatons of $(1, 2,
\dots, n)$.
