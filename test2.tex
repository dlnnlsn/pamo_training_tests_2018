\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Combinatorics Exercise 1
Abimbola plays heads or tails with a coin. A sequence of tosses is said to be
admissable if he gets an odd number of consecutive ``heads" followed by one
``tail". (For instance, HHHHTTHHTHT is admissable, but THHHHTTHHT is not
admissable.) How many admissable tosses of length $n$ do we have?

\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Algebra Exercise 4
Find all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x) + y) = f(x^2
- y) + 4f(x)y$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Arithmetic Exercise 2
For which prime numbers $p$ can we find three positive integers $n$, $x$ and $y$
such that $p^n = x^3 + y^3$?
