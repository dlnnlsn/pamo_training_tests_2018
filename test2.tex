\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Combinatorics Exercise 1
Abimbola plays a game with a coin. He tosses the coin a number of times, and
records whether each toss was a ``heads" or ``tails". He stops tossing the coin
as soon as he tosses an odd number of heads in a row, followed by a tails.
(Note that he stops if the number of heads since the previous time that he
tosses tails is odd, and he then tosses another tails. If he has not tossed
tails previously, then he stops if the total number of heads is odd, and he then
tosses tails.) How many different sequences of coin tosses are there such that
he stops after the $n^\text{th}$ coin toss?

\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Algebra Exercise 4
Find all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x) + y) = f(x^2
- y) + 4f(x)y$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

\item % PAMO Shortlist 2017 Arithmetic Exercise 2
For which prime numbers $p$ can we find three positive integers $n$, $x$ and $y$
such that $p^n = x^3 + y^3$?
